Description: Mixtures of life distributions provide a convienient framework for
    survival analysis: particularly when standard models such as the Weibull 
    are unable to capture some features from the data. These mixtures can also
    account for unobserved heterogeneity or outlying observations.
    BASSLINE uses shape mixtures of log-normal distributions and has particular 
    applicability to data with fat tails.
