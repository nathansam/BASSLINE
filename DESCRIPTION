Description: Mixtures of life distributions provide a convienient framework for
    survival analysis: particularly when standard models such as the Weibull or
    the log-normal are unable to capture some features from the data. These
    mixtures can also account for unobserved heterogeneity or outlying
    observations.
    BASSLINE uses shape mixtures of log-normal distributions to fit data with
    various tail behaviour. Accelerated failure time (AFT) regressions are used
    over proportional hazard models as AFT provides a clearer interpretation of
    the regression parameters.
